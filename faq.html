    <h2>Why do people wear hats?</h2>
    <p>
      People wear hats for many reasons, including protection from weather,
      cultural traditions, professional requirements, and personal style.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="mb-4 p-4 bg-white rounded shadow-sm">
    <h2>How do I know my hat size?</h2>
    <p>
      Hat size is typically based on head circumference. Measuring around the widest
      part of your head and using a size chart or calculator can help determine a proper fit.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="mb-4 p-4 bg-white rounded shadow-sm">
    <h2>Are hats still considered formal wear?</h2>
    <p>
      Some hats are still worn for formal occasions, but many modern hats are casual.
      Today, hats are more often used as fashion accessories than social requirements.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="mb-4 p-4 bg-white rounded shadow-sm">
    <h2>Why did hats become less common in daily wear?</h2>
    <p>
      Changes in fashion, transportation, and workplace norms during the mid-20th century
      reduced the need for everyday hats, making them optional rather than expected.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow-sm">
    <h2>Can hats be worn year-round?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes. Lightweight hats provide sun protection in warm weather, while insulated
      hats help retain warmth during colder months.
