    <h2>1000–1300: Practical Protection</h2>
    <p>
      In the medieval period, hats were primarily worn for protection against the elements.
      Simple felt caps, hoods, and brimmed hats helped shield people from sun, rain, and cold.
      Style was secondary to function.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="mb-4 p-4 bg-white rounded shadow-sm">
    <h2>1300–1600: Status and Identity</h2>
    <p>
      As societies became more structured, hats began to signal social class and occupation.
      Laws in parts of Europe even dictated who could wear certain types of headwear.
      Hats became symbols of rank and authority.
    </p>

  <section class="mb-4 p-4 bg-white rounded shadow-sm">
    <h2>1600–1800: Fashion Takes Hold</h2>
    <p>
      Decorative hats grew popular during the Renaissance and early modern period.
      Wide-brimmed hats, tricorns, and elaborate headpieces became common among the wealthy,
      while simpler versions remained popular among workers.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="mb-4 p-4 bg-white rounded shadow-sm">
    <h2>1800–1900: Industrialization</h2>
    <p>
      Industrial manufacturing made hats more affordable and widely available.
      Styles like top hats, bowlers, and straw hats became everyday wear for many people.
      Hats were considered essential parts of daily dress.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="mb-4 p-4 bg-white rounded shadow-sm">
    <h2>1900–1950: Everyday Necessity</h2>
    <p>
      In the early 20th century, most people owned multiple hats for different occasions.
      Hats were worn to work, social events, and formal gatherings.
      Going out without a hat was often seen as improper.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow-sm">
    <h2>1950–Present: Personal Expression</h2>
    <p>
      After the mid-20th century, hats became less of a requirement and more of a choice.
      Baseball caps, beanies, and fashion hats now reflect personal style, cultural identity,
      and practicality rather than social obligation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="mb-4 p-4 bg-white rounded shadow-sm">
  <h2>2000s–Present: Streetwear and Cultural Revival</h2>
  <p>
    In the 21st century, hats have become closely tied to streetwear, branding,
    and cultural identity. Baseball caps, snapbacks, beanies, and bucket hats
    are widely worn as casual fashion items rather than formal accessories.
    Social media, celebrity influence, and sports culture have played a major
    role in shaping modern hat trends.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, hats are often used to express individuality, support teams or brands,
    and adapt to lifestyle needs. While traditional hats still exist, modern
    headwear emphasizes comfort, versatility, and personal style over social
    expectations.
